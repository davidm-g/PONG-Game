## Grade: 17.4/20

## Description
For this project, our group decided to make a spin-off of the classic and revolutionary Pong, made by Atari in 1972.
We decided on this game because although it is simple, allowing us to focus on following good object-oriented design practices,
with close attention to the use of appropriate design patterns and complete testing, it also is different from previous projects and exercises we have done,
in the sense that we need to implement some features that were not formerly explored in our lectures, like the physics of the ball.

This project was developed by Afonso Domingues, David Gonçalves and Tomás Marques for LDTS 2023-24.
